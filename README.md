# Final-project-Fall-2018

This project was completed in the Fall of 2018. The class it was for focused on the Software development life cycle. 

The project was completed by my team of 4 people over 12 weeks using Scrum. 

My role in the project was the Product Owner. I purposed the project, got it accepted and it was created. 
In the development, I did a little of everything, but mainly focused on the main UI of the application.
